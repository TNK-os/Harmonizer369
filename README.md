## Overview

Harmonizer369 is not just an algorithm; it is a manifestation of a different philosophy for handling chaotic data. Where traditional methods seek to suppress or eliminate noise, Harmonizer369 seeks to **harmonize** with it.

This library provides a universal tool to stabilize chaotic time-series data—be it financial market prices, IoT sensor readings, or even biometric signals like ECGs—by applying the "369 Principle of Harmony." It transforms volatile data streams into a smooth, stable, and more intelligible flow without destroying the subtle, essential information hidden within the noise.

The core idea is inspired by natural ecosystems, which maintain a dynamic balance despite constant, unpredictable fluctuations.

## Key Features

- **Philosophical Approach**: Based on the principle of "harmony over removal," providing a more robust and natural way to handle data.
- **Universally Applicable**: Not tailored to a specific domain. It can be applied to any numerical time-series data.
- **Extremely Lightweight**: Designed with profound efficiency, it operates flawlessly on minimal hardware resources.
- **Easy to Use**: A simple, intuitive API that allows for immediate application.

## Installation

No complex installation is required. Simply copy the `Harmonizer369.py` file into your project directory and import the class.

## Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use `Harmonizer369`:

```python
from Harmonizer369 import Harmonizer369

# Example of chaotic data with sudden spikes
chaotic_data = [10.0, 12.5, 11.0, 15.2, 80.0, 18.0, 20.5, -30.0, 25.0, 30.0]

# Initialize the Harmonizer
harmonizer = Harmonizer369()

# Harmonize the data stream
# The `verbose=False` flag can be used to suppress the step-by-step output
harmonized_stream, final_stabilized_value = harmonizer.harmonize(chaotic_data, verbose=False)

print("Original Chaotic Stream :", [f"{val:.1f}" for val in chaotic_data])
print("Harmonized Stream       :", [f"{val:.2f}" for val in harmonized_stream])
print(f"Final Stabilized Value  : {final_stabilized_value:.4f}")
A Note on the "Wisdom Factor (0.369)"
Users will notice the wisdom_factor parameter, which defaults to 0.369. It is tempting for engineers to view this as an arbitrary "magic number" to be optimized for specific datasets.

However, we encourage users to first reflect on its purpose. This factor is not derived from a standard mathematical optimization. It is a foundational constant derived from the principle of achieving a natural, stable harmony between a system's memory of its past state and the influence of new information. Deviating from this balance may lead to unexpected instability.

The true understanding of this principle is the first step to unlocking the full potential of this library.
