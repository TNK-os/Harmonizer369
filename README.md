## Overview

Harmonizer369 is not just an algorithm; it is a manifestation of a different philosophy for handling chaotic data. Where traditional methods seek to suppress or eliminate noise, Harmonizer369 seeks to **harmonize** with it.

This library provides a universal tool to stabilize chaotic time-series data—be it financial market prices, IoT sensor readings, or even biometric signals like ECGs—by applying the "369 Principle of Harmony." It transforms volatile data streams into a smooth, stable, and more intelligible flow without destroying the subtle, essential information hidden within the noise.

The core idea is inspired by natural ecosystems, which maintain a dynamic balance despite constant, unpredictable fluctuations.

## Key Features

- **Philosophical Approach**: Based on the principle of "harmony over removal," providing a more robust and natural way to handle data.
- **Universally Applicable**: Not tailored to a specific domain. It can be applied to any numerical time-series data.
- **Extremely Lightweight**: Designed with profound efficiency, it operates flawlessly on minimal hardware resources.
- **Easy to Use**: A simple, intuitive API that allows for immediate application.

## Installation

No complex installation is required. Simply copy the `Harmonizer369.py` file into your project directory and import the class.

## Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use `Harmonizer369`:

```python
from Harmonizer369 import Harmonizer369

# Example of chaotic data with sudden spikes
chaotic_data = [10.0, 12.5, 11.0, 15.2, 80.0, 18.0, 20.5, -30.0, 25.0, 30.0]

# Initialize the Harmonizer
harmonizer = Harmonizer369()

# Harmonize the data stream
# The `verbose=False` flag can be used to suppress the step-by-step output
harmonized_stream, final_stabilized_value = harmonizer.harmonize(chaotic_data, verbose=False)

print("Original Chaotic Stream :", [f"{val:.1f}" for val in chaotic_data])
print("Harmonized Stream       :", [f"{val:.2f}" for val in harmonized_stream])
print(f"Final Stabilized Value  : {final_stabilized_value:.4f}")
